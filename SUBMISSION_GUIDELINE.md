# Submission Guideline

All artists data in ArtistDB must be clear, not misleading, also be checked by our team.

We have some rules for the artists data:

## Rule

0. Do not submit a musical artist; this is for an artist who draws
1. Never submit a fake/non-existent artist
2. Never submit an AI artist (post all AI images)
3. Never submit missing required artist data fields
4. You can submit artists who **recently** use AI to draw because we will verify it and mark it as [Removed Artist](#removed-artist) if so
5. If the artist is a group/duo, please submit each artist in the group/duo as a separate artist
6. If the artist has other aliases, please submit only one artist and add other aliases in the artist data, and do not submit the same person with multiple artist aliases
7. At least 1 or more social media link is required
8. Do not submit artists that have been submitted before. Check the artist list before submitting
9. If you try to submit the media for the artist showcase, you must ask the artist for permission first. Do not submit NSFW content without nsfw warning turned on
10. Do not submit private information about the artist like home address, phone number, email, etc, unless the artist has public information or explicitly allows it.

## Removed Artist

Removed Artist is a list of artists that we have identified as problematic, having been found to use AI to draw recently, including those with criminal or plagiarism-related issues, and other reasons. Once we verify it, we will put in removed artist list.

The reason is to preserve the data and will let the user know the reason for the artist with multiple citations.

Artists who have been marked as removed artists will be put on notice with multiple citations on the website. In rare cases, if an artist has requested us we remove it due to privacy or other reasons, we will remove it from the database within 7-30 days.
